/// What the session screen's detail column says when the selected Agent is no

///
/// Six situations empty that list and the screen has to tell them apart.
/// Every non-`.connected` status runs `invalidateSnapshot()`, so a Host that
/// failed and a Host that is reconnecting each clear `agentsByPane` exactly as
/// a closed pane does — and the placeholder then blamed the Agent for the
/// Host's trouble, while the text written for the failure rendered only in the
/// Console list behind the screen: the guidance on `.failed`, the shorter
/// phrase that list composes on `.reconnecting`. Which surface renders which
/// text is Transport Error Presentation in `CONTEXT.md`; what this suite
/// pins is what reaches this screen.
///
/// So the tests cover all six causes and the fields that carry them —
/// message, title, icon, and rendering mode — plus which Host the screen
/// reads them from, and that the column reads the live stores rather than a
/// snapshot (#152).
///
/// #142 is what made that routine rather than rare: every foreground return
/// re-proves the connection, so a herdr stopped while the app was away takes
/// the Host terminally to `.failed` on return. That behaviour is intended and
/// `herdrStoppedWhileAwayFailsTheHostWithItsSetupGuidance` pins it; the
/// guidance being right is what makes it worse that it was unreadable.
